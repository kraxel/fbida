.SH NAME
fbi - linux \fBf\fPrame\fBb\fPuffer \fBi\fPmageviewer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fbi [ options ] file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fbi
displays the specified file(s) on the linux console using the
framebuffer device.  PhotoCD, jpeg, ppm, gif, tiff, xwd, bmp and png
are supported directly.  For other formats fbi tries to use
ImageMagick's convert.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
print usage info
.TP
.B -d device
framebuffer device to use.  Default is the one your vc is
mapped to.
.TP
.B -m mode
name of the video mode to use video mode (must be listed in
/etc/fb.modes).  Default is not to change the video mode.
.TP
.B -q
be quiet: don't print anything.
.TP
.B -v
be verbose: allways print filenames.
.TP
.B -P
Enable textreading mode.  This has the effect that fbi will display
large images without vertical offset (default is to center the
images).  Space will first try to scroll down and go to the next image
only if it is already on the bottom of the page.  Useful if the images
you are watching text pages, all you have to do to get the next piece
of text is to press space...
.TP
.B -t sec
timeout: load next image after >sec< seconds without any
keypress
.TP
.B -g gamma
gamma correction.  Can also be put into the FBGAMMA environment
variable.  Default is 1.0.  Requires Pseudocolor or Directcolor
visual, doesn't work for Truecolor.
.TP
.B -r n
select resolution.  PhotoCD only, n = 1..5.
.TP
.B -s n
set scroll steps in pixels (default is 50).
.TP
.B -f font
Set font.  This can be either a pcf console font file or a X11 font
spec.  Using X11 fonts requires a font server (The one specified in
the environment variable FONTSERVER or on localhost).  The FBFONT
environment variable is used as default.  If unset, fbi will
fallback to 10x20 (X11) / lat1u-16.psf (console).
.TP
.B -a
Enable autozoom.  fbi will automagically pick a reasonable zoom factor
when loading a new image.
.TP
.B --autoup
Like autozoom, but scale up only.
.TP
.B --autodown
Like autozoom, but scale down only.
.TP
.B -u
Randomize the order of the filenames.
.TP
.B -e
Enable editing commands.
.TP
.B -b
create backup files (when editing images).
.TP
.B -p
preserve timestamps (when editing images).
.TP
.B --comments
Display comment tags (if present) instead of the filename.  Probaby
only useful if you added reasonable comments yourself (using wrjpgcom
for example), otherwise you likely just find texts pointing to the
software which created the image.
.SH KEYS
.nf
cursor keys     scroll large images
+, -            zoom in/out
ESQ, Q          quit
PgUp            previous image
PgDn, Space     next image
Return          next image, write the filename of the current
                image to stdout.
P               pause the slideshow (if started with -t, toggle)
<number>g       jump to image #<number>
.fi
.P
The Return vs. Space key thing can be used to create a file list while
reviewing the images and use the list for batch processing later on.
.SH EDIT IMAGE
fbi also provides some very basic image editing facilities.  You have
to start fbi with the -e switch to use them.
.P
.nf
Shift+D         delete image
R               rotate 90° clockwise
L               rotate 90° counter-clock wise
.fi
.P
The delete function actually wants a capital letter 'D', thus you have
to type Shift+D.  This is done to avoid deleting images by mistake
because there are no safety bells:  If you ask fbi to delete the image,
it will be deleted without questions asked.
.P
The rotate function actually works for JPEG images only because it
calls the jpegtran command to perform a lossless rotation if the image.
It is especially useful if you review the images of your digital
camera.
.SH COMMON PROBLEMS
.B fbi
needs rw access to the framebuffer devices (/dev/fbN), i.e you (our
your admin) have to make sure fbi can open the devices in rw mode.
The IMHO most elegant way is to use pam_console (see
/etc/security/console.perms) to chown the devices to the user logged
in on the console.  Another way is to create some group, chown the
special files to that group and put the users which are allowed to use
the framebuffer device into the group.  You can also make the special
files world writable, but be aware of the security implications this
has.  On a private box it might be fine to handle it this way
througth.
.P
.B fbi
also needs access to the linux console (i.e. /dev/ttyN) for sane
console switch handling.  That is obviously no problem for console
logins, but any kind of a pseudo tty (xterm, ssh, screen, ...) will
.B not
work.
